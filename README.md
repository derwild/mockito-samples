# mockito-samples

Just a simple project containing some sample code to demonstrate the usage of the Mockito Test Library together with JUnit 5.  
Feel free to use the code to your hearts content or request a merge if there is more to demonstrate.

Note that these examples are written for JUnit 5, but most of them will probably also work with JUnit 4 or even other test libraries.
